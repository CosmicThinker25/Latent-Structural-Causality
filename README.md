## Overview

This repository contains the paper **“Latent Structural Causality: Defining Physical Existence in Pre-Observable Regimes”**, a conceptual contribution to the foundations of cosmology and the philosophy of physics.

The work introduces a new framework—**Latent Structural Causality (LSC)**—to describe physical entities that are fully defined within fundamental theories but remain dynamically inactive in certain regimes of the universe. Rather than being created *ex nihilo*, observable phenomena emerge when conditions change and previously silent structures become operative.

## Core Idea (Plain Language)

In modern physics, we often assume that something only “exists” if it can be observed. However, cosmology challenges this assumption.

This work argues that:
- Physical laws (such as gravity or electromagnetism) can **exist structurally** even when they produce **no observable effects**.
- Observables emerge not from non-existence, but from a **change of regime**.
- The early universe can be described consistently without invoking metaphysical creation events.

These ideas are formalized through **Latent Structural Causality** and the principle of **Retrospective Necessity**.

## What Is Latent Structural Causality?

A physical interaction is said to be *latently causal* when:
- It is explicitly present in the fundamental formalism (Hamiltonian, symmetries).
- The global state of the system prevents it from producing measurable effects.
- A later transition (symmetry breaking, decoupling, phase desynchronization) makes it operative.

In short:

> **The law is there, but it is silent.**

## Examples Discussed in the Paper

The framework is grounded in well-established physics:

- **Photons before recombination**  
  Light existed, but could not propagate freely or carry information.

- **Mass before electroweak symmetry breaking**  
  The Higgs field and couplings were present, yet particles behaved as massless.

- **Gravity in perfectly symmetric early regimes**  
  Gravity is structurally defined, but without gradients it cannot produce observable effects.

These examples show that latency is not speculative—it is already implicit in standard physics.

## Application to Cosmology

The paper applies LSC to **phase-driven cosmological models**, including **CPT-symmetric (“siamese”) scenarios**.

In these models:
- Perfect phase synchronization suppresses gravitational operativity.
- A minimal phase desynchronization acts as a critical parameter.
- Gravity and time emerge as **transitions of operativity**, not acts of creation.

This allows a coherent description of pre-observable or pre-geometric regimes without singularities.

## Retrospective Necessity

Because latent regimes produce no direct observables, their existence is inferred **retrospectively**.

The principle of **Retrospective Necessity** states that:

> The present observable universe would be mathematically incoherent if certain structural constraints had not existed in the past, even if they were not operative at the time.

This provides a rigorous epistemological basis for discussing the early universe.
